This is a Facebook interview question.
They ask for the intersection, which has a trivial solution using a hash or a set.

Then they ask you to solve it under these constraints:
O(n) time and O(1) space (the resulting array of intersections is not taken into consideration).
You are told the lists are sorted.

Cases to take into consideration include:
duplicates, negative values, single value lists, 0's, and empty list arguments.
Other considerations might include
sparse arrays.

class Solution {
    public int[] intersection(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : nums1) {
            set.add(i);
        }

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i : nums2) {
            if(set.contains(i)){
                result.add(i);
                set.remove(i);
            }
        }

        int[] ints = new int[result.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
            ints[i]=result.get(i);
        }
        return ints;
    }
}
